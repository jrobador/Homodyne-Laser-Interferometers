Hello everyone!

You can check our thesis report on this document (in spanish):

[Diseño de medidor de desplazamiento interferómetrico](https://www.invap.com.ar/wp-content/uploads/formidable/8/Proyecto_Final-Orozco-Robador-Villanueva.pdf)

We hope to keep continuing on this project, we have some clever ideas to apply that can make the things absolutely better. We also have the implementation code that we used on a STM32F429, we need to commit it here.

Update: Voila! The most important STM32F429 implementation code was uploaded. Maybe adding the whole project is better?
